ATK recently announced that it has won a $3.2 million contract award through the Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program to provide the low-cost, light-weight, precision Guided Advanced Tactical Rocket (GATR) for evaluation by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  McCormick Stevenson played an important role in ATK’s success through the mechanical design and structural analysis of the Precision Guided Rocket Launcher (PGRL).  The PGRL is a family of smart rocket launchers that has the capability of launching GATR as well as legacy 2.75” Hydra rockets.  The PGRL is configurable for several rotary wing platforms using an adaptable connector interface and will be tested and evaluated on the MH-60L/M rotary wing platform as part of the DAC Program.
