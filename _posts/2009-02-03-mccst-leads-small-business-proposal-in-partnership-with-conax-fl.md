McCormick Stevenson recently coupled our program management skills and small business status with the engineering strength of Conax Florida to submit a proposal to the Army Research, Development and Engineering Command in Natick, MA for the development, testing and supply of the next generation of Cargo Parachute Release system.  The partnership was forged through the valuable contacts garnered from our involvement in the Pinellas Area Federeal Contractors Association (PAFCA).  The team proposed a revolutionary design that will protect air dropped cargo from damage upon reaching the ground through the timely detachment of the parachutes from the cargo.  McCormick Stevenson is proud to be a leader in the small business sector and anticipates further opportunities to explore answers to the exciting challenges of our future with our larger corporate colleagues!
