<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-452" title="Alakai" src="http://mccst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Alakai1-300x90.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="90" />When the very capable engineering staff at Alakai Defense Systems was challenged with more mechanical engineering and design work than it could handle internally, they turned to McCormick Stevenson.  As fellow members of the Florida Federal Contractors Association (FFCA), Alakai and MCCST were able to leverage an existing, trusted relationship to more effectively meet the needs of the warfighter.  Over the coming weeks, MCCST will assist Alakai in finalizing the second-generation Checkpoint Explosive Detection System, or CPEDS, a state-of-the-art remote explosives detection system which will help keep our soldiers safe.  The system will be tested at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri later this year.
