<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-440" title="spaceclaim" src="http://mccst.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/spaceclaim-300x199.gif" alt="" width="300" height="199" />The MCCST analysis team was one of the first to use the ANSYS SpaceClaim 3D Direct Modeler which is designed to enable engineering and analysis teams to collaborate more efficiently by facilitating access to 3D models and data across the engineering team. As a customer-centric organization, McCormick Stevenson can take models created in any CAD system, import them into SpaceClaim seamlessly, and then prepare them for analysis work in ANSYS Workbench.  By empowering our CAE team to create and edit CAD designs using direct modeling in SpaceClaim, we’re delivering optimized solutions without time-consuming interoperability issues. We can then provide more value to our customers and help them get products to market faster.** **
