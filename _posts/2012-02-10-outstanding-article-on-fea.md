As one of our core competencies here at McCormick Stevenson, we take finite-element analysis very seriously.  Many of our clients come to us specifically for that service, so it is more than just a tool that we “occasionally” use to validate our own designs.  Our analysts ARE design engineers and they ARE trained in not just the use of the tool, but the much more important topic of FE ….. it’s use, constraints, application, and interpretation.

The following outstanding article from Machine Design written by Paul Kurowski, President, Acom Consulting in Toronto points out the pitfalls of believing that anyone can perform FE analysis with today’s advanced tools.
