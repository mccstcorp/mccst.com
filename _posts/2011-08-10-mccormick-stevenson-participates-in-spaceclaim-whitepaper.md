McCormick Stevenson collaborated with SpaceClaim Corporation in their development of a whitepaper titled “Overcoming the Barriers Imposed by Geometry”.  McCormick Stevenson has realized significant value in the SpaceClaim™ tool when dealing with non-parametric import geometry, and we were happy to share that experience with other potential SpaceClaim™ users.  You can download a free copy of the whitepaper by clicking on the following link:  <http://www.spaceclaim.com/en/Resources/WhitePapers.aspx>
