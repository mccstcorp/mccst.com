<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-518" title="phototelesis" src="http://mccst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/phototelesis2.bmp" alt="" />As a result of our successful relationship with Symetrics Industries, we were recently approached by their sister division <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=y5ywn7cab&et=1103828321097&s=0&e=001OC_WDfeDmTZuMZZqgVA7_J3NvTFHOdneBzJT6ALADD6H29dhZnaQsChZv__IIl1-Xn08po5vpmOX2Oy0hvFGutFRmiEINrWKbAr0AV3UuH5VQH3_6tUaEw==" target="_blank">PhotoTelesis, Inc.</a> in San Antonio, TX.  Faced with a thermal challenge on a new piece of flight equipment, PhotoTelesis contracted McCormick Stevenson to provide computational fluids dynamics (CFD) analysis of the product in its thermal environment.  Our mission was to identify opportunities for thermal optimization throughout the design, and demonstrate the return on the investment analytically before the first piece of metal was cut.  PhotoTelesis recognized the value in cost and schedule savings that could be realized through the careful application of finite element analysis.
