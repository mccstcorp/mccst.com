<img class="image-regular" style="float: right;" src="/wp-content/themes/mccst/images/mccst-lobby.png" alt="MCCST Office" />Founded in 1999, McCormick Stevenson was formed to provide mechanical engineering services in a more meaningful way than the typical “job shop” or placement firm.  We wanted to provide a ***solution***, not just a resource.  Through teamwork we apply diverse experience to your problem.  Our creativity and technical expertise result in innovative, yet sound solutions.  Our leadership embraces responsibility for your design challenges, and will provide decisive action while holding ourselves accountable for the results.  With professionalism and commitment to our clients, McCormick Stevenson will be there for you–both today, and tomorrow as well.  Throughout it all, thick and thin, we strive for mutual respect, friendliness, and enthusiasm!
