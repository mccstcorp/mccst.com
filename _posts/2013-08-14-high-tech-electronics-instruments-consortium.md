I look forward to this evening’s Summer Meeting of the HTEI Consortium at Orbeco-Hellige in Sarasota, FL. Sponsored by the Tampa Bay Partnership, the Consortium’s members include organizations in service to our Tampa Bay region’s <a title="HTEI Background" href="http://www.tampabay.org/business-clusters/high-tech-electronics-instruments#region-postscript" target="_blank">High‐Tech Electronics & Instruments</a> sector.  Our Charter members include: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Association for Operations Management (APICS), Bay Area Manufacturers Association (BAMA), Florida Federal Contractors Association (FFCA), Florida Medical Manufacturers Consortium (FMMC), National Tooling and Machining Association (NTMA), Sarasota Manatee Manufacturers Association (SAMA), Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME), and Tampa Bay Partnership.  
The HTEI Consortium will reconvene in early December – please <a title="Noel's Page" href="http://mccst.com/team/noel-mccormick/" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you’d like to learn more about our activities.
