Praxis, Inc. has contracted McCormick Stevenson to assist with the design and development of a wireless communications device for use in the PCI Express slot of ruggedized laptop computers.  This device, intended for use by military personnel, must be capable of surviving the rigors of ‘in theater’ use and McCormick Stevenson’s experience with the packaging of electronics in harsh environments will be instrumental to the product’s success.
