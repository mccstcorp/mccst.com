<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-498" title="nasa" src="http://mccst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nasa2.bmp" alt="" />Plans are underway for a large contingency from the Space Center Houston area to head to Washington in early March to meet with Freshmen Members of Congress.  This will be a very important trip, planned to help educate these new members on the benefits of a healthy space program for our country.  Many of these new members were elected in hopes of them cutting the federal budget, and they need to know that space exploration is an investment in our country’s future and that the NASA budget is less than ½ of 1% of the federal budget.

**“With the current climate on the hill in D.C., this is expected to be a very important trip, that could help to determine what direction our country’s human spaceflight program will take in upcoming years “.  – David Braun, Aerospace Marketing Manager, Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership **
