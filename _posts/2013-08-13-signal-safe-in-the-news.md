At McCormick Stevenson we love nothing more than helping our clients reach their goals.  It’s particularly fun to serve entrepreneurs with great ideas, and Bob Townsend is a perfect example.  After experiencing Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Bob contacted McCormick Stevenson with an idea for an improved, hurricane-resistant traffic signal to keep cars moving safely after a storm.  Bob immediately formed <a title="Signal Safe, Inc." href="http://www.signalsafeinc.com/" target="_blank">Signal Safe Inc</a>, and brought his idea and his passion to McCormick Stevenson.  We added a bit of mechanical engineering and analysis expertise, and the result was an affordable retrofit for existing signals — allowing hurricane evacuation routes to remain open before, during and after a storm.  Our hats are off to Bob for his great work, and for this recent feature on South Florida’s <a title="Signal Safe News Story" href="http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/region_c_palm_beach_county/west_palm_beach/south-florida-man-invents-hurricane-device-aimed-to-prevent-collapsing-traffic-signals-during-storm" target="_blank">WTPV newscast</a>.
