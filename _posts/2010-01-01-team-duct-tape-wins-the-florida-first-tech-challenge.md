MCCST was proud to see Team Duct Tape take their robotic design to the FIRST Tech Challenge, where they won the Florida State Championships!  Next up, the national competition – where we are sure their robot will rise to the challenge!

The staff at MCCST helped these super bright teens complete their design using the latest Pro/ENGINEER software.  We could not be more proud to have our logo on their bot!
