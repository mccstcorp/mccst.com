With over 14 years of commercial & military aerospace engineering experience with Lockheed Martin, Ball Aerospace, and Goodrich, Diana is well equipped to lead the business development effort for our expansion into the Texas region.   Her experience as a structural analyst, program manager and engineering manager gives her a unique perspective to understand your company’s concerns.   With a BS in Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and an MS in Engineering from the University of Michigan, Diana vigorously supports her two alma maters (particularly during the fall football season) and loves to run and play with her son.
