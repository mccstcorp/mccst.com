I’ve learned an awful lot over the last dozen years of small business ownership, but among the most important lessons has been the need for companies to band together if they intend to succeed.  This is particularly true for small businesses in our world of Aerospace & Defense.  Thankfully organizations like the FFCA make finding trusted teammates possible.  With nearly 60 member companies, the FFCA is a fast-growing business league designed to ensure that Florida defense companies, large and small, are well-acquainted and well-prepared to meet the needs of the Federal marketplace.  When a solicitation hits the streets, it’s too late to start looking around for partners — that’s an ongoing job, made easy by the FFCA.  If you’re business strategy includes a growing Federal component, you owe it to yourself to join in the fun!
