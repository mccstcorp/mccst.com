<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-514" title="signal safe" src="http://mccst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/signal-safe2.bmp" alt="" />In 2009, MCCST presented to the Florida Senate the benefits of the Signal Safe product for protection of traffic signals during hurricane season.  Subsequently, Signal Safe devices have been installed, on a pilot program basis, along major hurricane evacuation routes in the Tampa Bay area.  The successful completion of this pilot program will see the Signal Safe product protecting drivers throughout Florida.  MCCST has proudly supported Signal Safe for over 3 years with design, drafting, and analysis services and we are happy to see the goals of Signal Safe are fast becoming reality!
