Our own Noel McCormick was one of the presenters at the first “Ignite Tampa Bay” event held on July 28, 2011 at the Wyndham Hotel in Tampa.  ”Ignite” events have been held all over the United States, and provide an information exchange for fostering and inspiring an area’s creative community. In one evening, you hear passionate speakers from the local arts, technical, health, education, and business communities talk about their current projects or favorite ideas for just five minutes.

Presentations will educate and inspire you, and maybe make you laugh in the process. The presenters are limited to 20 slides and 5 minutes. Not a second more. The presenters need to get to the point quickly and make it exciting and engaging. They welcome topics about anything that other people will find interesting.
