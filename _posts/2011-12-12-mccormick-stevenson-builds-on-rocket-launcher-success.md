As a result of the overwhelming success of our previous launcher project with ATK Energetic Systems located in Radford, VA and Arnold Defense & Electronics located in Arnold, MO, we continued our great relationship with them in the development of a new, fully integrated ATK rocket launcher.  This launcher is designed specifically for the firing of ATK’s “smart”, guided munitions.  Unlike our previous effort on their behalf, (i.e., the development of a launcher for rotary wing aircraft) this launcher was designed to withstand the increased maneuverability and aerodynamic loads experienced on a fixed wing aircraft.  Intended for flight testing later this year, the final product is pictured below with our own (left to right) Nat McCormick, Mike Krawczyk and Matt Montgomery, the Mechanical Drafter, Structural Analyst and lead Mechanical Engineer respectively.
