<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-490" title="symmetrics" src="http://mccst.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/symmetrics1.bmp" alt="" />Since October of 2009, McCormick Stevenson has been providing mechanical engineering and design services to <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=y5ywn7cab&et=1103828321097&s=0&e=001OC_WDfeDmTZuMZZqgVA7_J3NvTFHOdneBzJT6ALADD6H29dhZnaQsChZv__IIl1-Xn08po5vpmOX2Oy0hvFGuo79h00zJmggSff4a6aMjvRgmeD72pH__g==" target="_blank">Symetrics Industries</a> in support of their IDM-304B Program.  The legacy IDM-304 is the modem of choice for US Army Helicopters such as the Apache Longbow, Kiowa Warrior, Chinook and Blackhawk.  The “B” version of the device will provide the war-fighter with the latest technology, and increased reliability under these extremely harsh conditions.  Symetrics turned to McCormick Stevenson to supplement their internal engineering staff based on our experience with the mechanical hardening of electronics in military aircraft environments, our capabilities in structural and thermal engineering analysis, and our familiarity with the creation of ASME Y14.100 compliant documentation for the Department of Defense.  Ray Boggs, Director of Engineering for Symetrics had this to say about our engagement, **“I have turned to McCormick Stevenson to provide solutions to challenging mechanical designs for several years, both at Symetrics and in a previous position. They have continually exceeded my technical, cost and schedule performance expectations.”**
