Johnson Space Center. BAHEP provides the necessary support to keep this important industry cluster vibrant by fostering an environment of collaboration for the numerous aerospace initiatives.  MCCST Houston is proud to join these ranks and provide support to the NASA community at JSC!

The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) opened in the early 1960s and grew to become Mission Control for all U.S. manned space flight communications and control. Today JSC is responsible for:

*   Managing the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station and the Constellation Program
*   Selecting and training the astronauts
*   Operating and communicating with the shuttle and space station
*   Directing extravehicular activities
*   Leading the advanced human support technology program
*   Conducting biomedical research
*   Providing space medicine

These programs are driven by services in information technology, computer services, safety and quality assurance, life sciences, and advanced and precision manufacturing. All are skills and technologies that are easily transferred to multiple commercial markets, like defense, homeland security, oil & gas and biotech.

Several major U.S. aerospace companies such as The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Jacobs Engineering and United Space Alliance maintain a presence in Bay Area Houston to assist JSC in fulfilling its functions. JSC annually manages $4.0 billion in Federal aerospace contracts.
