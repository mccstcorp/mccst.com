The team at McCormick Stevenson is proud to announce the following staff promotions:

**Matt Montgomery** was promoted to **Senior Engineer** this past September based on his outstanding performance on several projects.  Matt has been with McCormick Stevenson for four years this past June, and is very well respected by his peers and our clients.  We look forward to continued technical leadership in his new role and responsibilities.

**Nat McCormick** was promoted to **Designer** this January after “serving” four years as a Drafter.  Coming to us initially with no experience, he has proven to be a quick understudy with a natural affinity for all things mechanical.  His creativity and “can do” attitude will continue to serve him well in his new role as he helps our clients design new products.

Please join us in congratulating these employees on their continued growth!
