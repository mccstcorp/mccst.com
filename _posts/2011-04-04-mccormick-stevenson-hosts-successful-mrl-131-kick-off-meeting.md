Members of the MRL-131 Development Team, including ATK Advanced Energetic Systems (out of Radford, VA), Arnold Defense & Electronics (out of St. Louis, MO), and ATK Defense Electronics Systems (out of Clearwater, FL) attended the program Kick-Off meeting here at McCormick Stevenson. The two day meeting was a huge success and the Florida weather contributed to the positive vibes. The program will run until a planned test flight in November/December time frame.
