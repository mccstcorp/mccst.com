Poor quality or inappropriate CAD geometry results in ongoing inefficiency in the analysis and simulation process.  To address this challenge at McCormick Stevenson, we’ve adopted the SpaceClaim 3-D modeling system as our standard geometry interface to both ANSYS and CFdesign.  For additional information, listen in as Noel McCormick contributes to the upcoming webinar: “Overcoming the Barriers Imposed by Geometry”.  Register <a title="SpaceClaim Webinar" href="https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/504486138" target="_blank">HERE</a> to join in on the discussion.
