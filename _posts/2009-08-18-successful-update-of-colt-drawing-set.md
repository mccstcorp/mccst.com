The McCormick Stevenson team successfully created 3-Dimensional solid models of the Colt Model XSE Rail Gun, converting a set of legacy paper drawings into modern Pro/ENGINEER CAD models and associated documentation. Through close interaction with the manufacturing team at Colt, this Model “O” design variant was brought into the modern era, ensuring easy and affordable data reuse for years to come!
